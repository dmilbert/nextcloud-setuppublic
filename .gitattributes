## **List of Known Errors:**
* /dev/urandom is not readable by PHP which is highly discouraged for security reasons. Further information can be found in the documentation.
* The “Strict-Transport-Security” HTTP header is not set to at least “15552000” seconds. For enhanced security, it is recommended to enable HSTS as described in the security tips.
* No memory cache has been configured. To enhance performance, please configure a memcache, if available. Further information can be found in the documentation.
* The PHP OPcache is not properly configured. For better performance it is recommended to use the following settings in the php.ini:
	* pcache.enable=1
	* opcache.enable_cli=1
	* opcache.interned_strings_buffer=8
	* opcache.max_accelerated_files=10000
	* opcache.memory_consumption=128
	* opcache.save_comments=1
	* opcache.revalidate_freq=1

## Error Solution:

Go into Plesk in the tab php in the selected domain find the listing: open_basedir in the file path listing insert the following line -> 
{WEBSPACEROOT}{/}{:}{TMP}{/}:/dev/urandom

To fix the HTTP header warning Go into Plesk in the tab nginx of the selected domain insert the folowing line -> 
add_header Strict-Transport-Security “max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains” always; in the “Additional NGINX directives block”

## Install a APCu module:

* yum install plesk-php70-devel zlib-devel gcc (change php70 current version of php e.g php72)
* /opt/plesk/php/7.x/bin/pecl install apcu (change 7.x current version of php e.g 7.2)
* echo "extension=apcu.so" > /opt/plesk/php/7.0/etc/php.d/apcu.ini (change 7.0 current version of php e.g 7.2)
* service plesk-php70-fpm restart (change php70 current version of php e.g php72)
* plesk bin php_handler --reread
* /opt/plesk/php/7.0/bin/php -i | grep apc.enabled  (change 7.0 current version of php e.g 7.2)
* add the following line into the config.php file -> 'memcache.local' => '\OC\Memcache\APCu',

Go into Plesk insert the following lines of code into the “Additional configuration directives block” ->  
```
pcache.enable=1
opcache.enable_cli=1
opcache.interned_strings_buffer=8
opcache.max_accelerated_files=10000
opcache.memory_consumption=128
opcache.save_comments=1
opcache.revalidate_freq=1
